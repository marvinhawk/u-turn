![u-turn-exploded](https://github.com/marvinhawk/u-turn/assets/24456924/6a139b4e-b252-46e3-a332-8507e20f1ddb)

U-turn is a 3d-printable keyboard case designed for Lesovoz by [SquashKB](https://squashkb.com/).

Apart from the six printed parts you will need:
- M2 X D3.5 X L3.0 inserts (8 pcs.)
- M2 X 10 mm screws (8 pcs.)
- A sheet of foam, neoprene or similar to pad the bottom (approx. 2 mm thick).

The PCB is fixed between the padded bottom and the accent layer. Tolerances are slightly large so additional padding may be necessary to keep the PCB from sliding around.

All parts are subject to change.
